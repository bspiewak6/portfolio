            <p>
                I am a results-driven marketing director with 10-plus years’ experience of innovation, branding, communications 
                and outreach. I have a strong track record driving revenue through the management of cross-functional creative, 
                research and operational teams. In addition, I believe that my determination, organization and will power allows 
                me to work in fast paced environments. My career up to this point has always provided challenging tasks, but it 
                has been a joy at the same time. I’ve worked with very talented people and it’s always pushed me to become better 
                at my craft.
