            <p>
                I am a results-driven marketing director with 10-plus years’ experience of innovation, branding, 
                communications and outreach. I have a strong track record driving revenue through the management 
                of cross-functional creative, research and operational teams. In addition, I believe that my 
                determination, organization and will power allows me to work in fast paced environments. My career 
                up to this point has always provided challenging tasks, but it has been a joy at the same time. I’ve 
                worked with very talented people and it’s always pushed me to become better at my craft.
